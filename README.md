Synesthetic World (Working Title)

Developed within Mac OS

Synesthetic World (working title) is a side-scrolling action game. The goal of the game is to collect sound crystals and proceed to the next stage. There will be enemies (Noises) attacking you and preventing you from getting the crystal. You can shoot bullets (Soundwaves) to eliminate them. The entire game experience builds up and enhances those connections between sounds, shapes, and colors to simulate the experience of those with synesthesia.



Instructions:

"Left Arrow" and "Right Arrow" to move
"Space" to jump
"X" to shoot
After acquiring crystals, use "A" and "D" to switch between abilities.

(Hint: Enemies can only be eliminated by crystal abilities of the same color.)
