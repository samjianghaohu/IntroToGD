Intro To Game Development

Monic
Developed within Mac OS

Monic is a 2D side-scrolling platformer. The game is developed with Unity, and is inspired by the idea of chords and harmony in music.

The goal of the game is to collect sound crystals and proceed to the next stage. There will be enemies attacking you and preventing you from getting the crystal. You shoot bullets to eliminate them. The visual and audio experience of the game enhances the perception of music harmony and dissonance.


Instructions:

"Left Arrow" and "Right Arrow" to move
"Up Arrow" to jump
"Space" to shoot
After acquiring crystals, use "Z" "X" "C" to switch back and forth among different abilities.

(Hint: Enemies can only be eliminated by crystal abilities of the same color.)
